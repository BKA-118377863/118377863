        <h1><Travel</h1>

        <div>I have travelled to many places, but theres no doubt there is many other places i want to go to. Ive been to spain and Portugal numerous times with my family which I really enjoyed. Last summer I went on  A 6th year holiday to Mallorca with my friends it was so muc fun but quite expensive. January 2019 my friends and I set off on a city break to liverpool for 3 nights we had a great time we really enjoyed the beattles museum and exploring the docks it was very prety. I am currently saving for my holiday during the summer me and my fiends are going to IOS, Greece i am very excited. Next year i hope to go on  J1 to America or Canada, I think that would be a great experience  </div>
